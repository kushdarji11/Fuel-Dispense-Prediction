# Fuel-Dispense-Prediction
Predicted various features based on known data using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms.
The Goal is to create an Esemble Model using Regression or Classification Algorithms which can accurately predict the required data, The tasks involved are :
Download the CSV File which contains the Dispense Log.
Visualization of the Data using Charts or Graphs.
Preprocess the Data  i.e Removing the Space or Null Values if any.
Handling Categorical or Label Encoding of the features.
Features Selection and Target Prediction.
Building the Data Model and Fitting the Featured  and Target Values.
Calculating Mean Absolute Error to determine the Accuracy of Models.
